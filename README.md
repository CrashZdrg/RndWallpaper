# RndWallpaper
Exclusive Random Wallpaper for Windows

### Description
I got tired of Windows repeating the same wallpapers, so I use this at Windows startup to change the wallpaper everyday without repeating the same image until all images in the folder are used.

You can run it with the argument 'force' to force it to change the wallpaper more times in a day.

### Notes
You can add more images to the folder without problem, but if you remove images it will start repeating earlier.

This code is rushed and there are almost any error check in the code, so maybe it just don't work for you.
